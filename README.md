1. Create a CodeSpace from this GitHub repository by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Open with CodeSpaces."
- you can also fork the repository and commit your project changes there as well)
- you can also create a separate repository for your project and clone it inside the codespace so you can develop and still commit your code

3. Wait for the CodeSpace to be created and initialized.

4. Once the CodeSpace is ready, you can start developing right away in the cloud.

5. Example setup in the CodeSpaces
```
symfony new symfony --webapp
```
Then `cd symfony` and `symfony serve` - now you can access you symfony instance and start developing.
